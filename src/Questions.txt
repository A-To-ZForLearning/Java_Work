1. On Friday afternoon your boss, knowing that you have big plans of watching the X-Files that night, 
saunters up and asked you to generate some reports for him. He wants you to print out the list of vehicles by price.


2. Just as you think you think you're done for the afternoon, your boss says he wants another report of vehicles.
 This time he wants a report generated that shows average cost per car type sorted by price. Knowing your boss, 
 you know he's going to ask for average cost per brand, per engine type and per color next, so build that out.
 
 
3. Build a REST web service in Spring Boot (spring.io) that returns that information above.

4. Summarize what happens in season 1 of the X-Files. (Just kiddingâ€¦or are we? The truth is out there)
